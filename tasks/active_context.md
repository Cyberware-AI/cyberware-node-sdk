# Active Context: Cyberware Node.js SDK Development

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

**Current Focus:** Finishing initial SDK v0.1.0 tasks.

**Recent Changes:**

- Implemented Unit Tests (`test/client.test.ts`) (1 skipped due to retry issue).
- Simplified retry test error assertion.
- Wrote `README.md`.
- Added TSDoc comments to source files.
- Refined response types (`AnalysisTaskResponse`, `SentimentResult`) based on updated Swagger.
- Removed configurable `baseURL` (using hardcoded production URL).
- Added example usage scripts (`examples/basic_usage.ts`, `discord_listener.ts`, `telegram_listener.ts`).
- Updated documentation files (`docs/`, `tasks/`).

**Active Decisions/Considerations:**

- `baseURL` is hardcoded to production.
- `SentimentResult` type is defined but not directly returned by current SDK methods.
- One retry unit test remains skipped.

**Next Steps:**

- Consider adding User-Agent header (Low Priority).
- Consider investigating skipped retry test further (Known Issue).
- Prepare for potential v0.1.0 release/packaging.
